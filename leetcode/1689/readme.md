# LeetCode 1689 - Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers

## Problem
Find the minimum number of deci-binary numbers that sum up to `n`.

## Solution
Return the maximum digit in the string, since each deci-binary number can contribute at most 1 to any digit position.

## Complexity
Let m = length of the string n.
- Time: O(m)
- Space: O(m)
