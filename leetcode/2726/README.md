# LeetCode 2726 - Calculator with Method Chaining

## Problem
Design a `Calculator` class that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and method chaining.

## Solution
Each arithmetic method mutates the internal result and returns `this` to enable method chaining. Division by zero throws an error as required.

## Complexity
- Time: O(1) per operation
- Space: O(1)
